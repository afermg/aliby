# Contributing

We focus our work on python 3.8 due to the current neural network being developed on tensorflow 1. In the near future we will migrate the network to pytorch to support more recent versions of all packages.

## Issues
All issues are managed within the gitlab [ repository ](https://gitlab.com/aliby/aliby/-/issues), if you don't have an account on the University of Edinburgh's gitlab instance and would like to submit issues please get in touch with [Prof. Peter Swain](mailto:peter.swain@ed.ac.uk ).

## Data aggregation

ALIBY has been tested by a few research groups, but we welcome new data sources for the models and pipeline to be as general as possible. Please get in touch with [ us ](mailto:peter.swain@ed.ac.uk ) if you are interested in testing it on your data.
